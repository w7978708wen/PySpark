# PySpark

I look forward to learning PySpark.

2. <a href="https://github.com/w7978708wen/PySpark/blob/main/PySpark_APIs_intro.ipynb"> PySpark APIs Introduction </a>

I am excited about browsing through the documentations to learn how to use APIs in PySpark. I am not yet familiar with how to integrate PySpark into a project, which is why I will find out more in this area. 

Fun fact is that I also know how to install PySpark on my machine, so it can also run in the Command Prompt.
